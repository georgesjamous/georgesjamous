# Hi there, I'm Georges Jamous 👋

Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile. It's good to have you here.

## About Me

I'm a passionate iOS/macOS developer based in the vibrant tech scene of Spain.
As my career evolved, so did my curiosity as I tinkered away with many different tools, languages and roles.

In my free time, I work on my personal projects, listen to as much music as possible, and spend time hiking up the mountain, sliding down the slopes or relaxing in the ocean waves.

I currently work as a Senior Mobile Engineer at **/// adidas**.
